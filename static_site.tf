# IMPORTANT: the CI's service account "tfstate-sa" must be able to access

#
#    gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding tfstate750 \
#        --role=roles/storage.admin \
#        --member=serviceAccount:tfstate-sa@tfstate750.iam.gserviceaccount.com
#
# I wished I could also create that binding here in the terraform config
# file, but there seems to be an egg-and-chicken issue here...
